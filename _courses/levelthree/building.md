      ## Project Log

      The things you will need to include in your daily log are:

      - **Progress**<br>
        Record tasks you have completed or work you have started
      - **Testing**<br>
        Test regularly when you are able to, and record the results
      - **Changes**<br>
        Record any changes to your plan and why they were made
