# Caesar Cipher

This cipher matches each letter of the alphabet with another letter by shifting the alignment by a set number of places. A Caesar cipher is traditionally shifted by 3 places, but the same concept can be applied for a shift of any number of places.

**For a shift of 3:**<br>
a becomes d<br>
b becomes e<br>
c becomes f<br>
x becomes a<br>
y becomes b<br>
z becomes c

## Have A Go

Here are a few activities to practice the Caesar cipher. You may want to use the alphabet reference to figure out the enciphered letters.

1. Encipher the word **axolotl** using a shift of **3**

2. Decipher the phrase **rk wkh kxjh pdqdwhh** which was encoded using a shift of **3**

3. Choose a shift that is **not 3** and encipher the name of your favourite movie.

4. Pass your enciphered movie name to a friend and tell them the shift so they can decode it.

5. Could you figure out an Caesar-enciphered message without knowing the shift? Explain.
