      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)

      Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

      In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages. 

      After that we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We will design a page layout and a menu bar.

      Later we will add some fancy extras to our site, like YouTube videos and a gallery.
